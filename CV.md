# Curriculum Vitae: Yizhar (Izzy) Toren

## Qualifications	(what I do)


### Analytics & Optimization
I learn the stakeholders’ world view and terminology and translate them into solvable analytical problems. I provide in depth analysis and deliver timely, practical recommendations. I’ve implemented behavioral analytics for segmentation and optimization and built NLP based recommendation systems.


### Statistics & machine learning
I design and build a wide array of statistical models - GLM/GAM, survival analysis, tree methods, neural nets, Bayesian methods, NLP, etc. I have designed controlled experiments, worked with data on small and large scale (from clinical trials to big data from production machines) and designed ETL process to engineer new data features, so I’m familiar with both experimental/ prototyping and engineering concepts.


### Teamwork & Delivery
I am responsible for end-to-end delivery of analytical projects. I headed teams of 2-5 consultants (10 projects in 3 years), from pre-sale and sales engineering to team leadership, managing customer expectations, technical support and hands on implementation.


### International experience
East to west: South Korea, Russia, Turkey, Poland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Nordics, UK, USA/Canada.


### Writing & presentation skills
I presented in several conferences, wrote white papers on customer behaviour and consulted on academic papers. See [publications section](publications.html)


### Programming / engineering skills
R (expert), Python, SQL, Excel/BI, NLP frameworks (spaCy) and some work R/PySpark, H2O, STAN and ElasticSearch.
